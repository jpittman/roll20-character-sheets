In progress character sheet for the Generic Universal Roleplaying System.

Styling is inspired primarily by GCS, but also with some influence from the official sheet. The goal was to design a reponsive character sheet that would look good even with a small screen width.


To the Future Authors - from Mike W (12/20/2018)
I need to mention that the original author(s) misspelled the words Miscellaneous (as Miscellwneous) and Encumbrance (as Encumberance) in both the CSS and HTML files. Rather than write extensive code to fix this, I just corrected the cosmetic portions only. Also note that the original author(s) use the word Fear in place of Fright although the proper word to use is Fright. As with the misspelled words, I changed no code other than the cosmetic side. This seemed simpler then spending hours writing code, transferring values from the attributes in question, and making sure it still functions. It also avoids having to explain it to the users in case they used those misspelled attributes in homemade macros.
