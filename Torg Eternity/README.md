Version 3.0
- Includes interim changes from Salmedo which added inline chat buttons to roll Possibilities and Ups folling a skill check (and an ingenious hack using the tracker, I might add)
- Added ability to mod attributes and skills (submitted to me by Torg Eternity community member Leamon - I take no credit for it)
- WE STILL NEED A next-gen Roll20 sheet formatting update to get this more in line with the newer R20 sheets like 5eOGL, Starfinder, etc. If you are a CSS guru and a fan of Torg E, this should be YOUR project. <G>
  
Version 2.0
- Added multiple roll templates
- Added roll buttons for all skills
- Added attack and damage roll buttons
- Added roll buttons for powers
- Added Current/Total XP Field, Clearance Field
- Modified Powers to include separate fields for various power elements, to better support roll template usage

Version 1.0 of Torg Eternity character sheet.

This is loosely based on the original torg sheet, which was in turn based on the basic Fantasy Craft character sheet (thanks to Jason Miller who created it). I've also cobbled together some code from other projects, including the Mongoose Traveller 2nd Ed sheets (for tabs).

I do not claim to be the best sheet deisgner around, by any stretch, and would be glad to hand this project off to anyone who thinks they have a higher level of competence.
