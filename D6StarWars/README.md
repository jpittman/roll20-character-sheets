# D6 StarWars Character Sheet

This is the Character sheet for the D6-Based  WEG Star Wars and the new D6 Star Wars games. The sheet is geared to 2E and REUP as the rolls use wild die, but the option to disable wild die and others are on the top upcoming improvement.
If you're looking to play 30th Annniversary Edition or 1E, "Star Wars 30th Anniversary Edition"-sheet by claes is recommemded

List your dice and pips next to the appropriate skills -  3pips equal another die.
The text areas are expandable for additional info.
