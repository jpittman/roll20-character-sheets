When you use the roll button you will see, in the chat log, a roll \"vs standard value/hard value/extreme value.\"  Compare the appropriate threshold to your result to determine success.  For weapon skill select one of the listed skills to base your weapon skill check on.  You may select up to the tenth custom skill as the base skill.  For weapon damages you may specify a \"+0\", \"+1/2db\" or \"+db.\"  Use this to include your damage bonus in the damage roll or not.\n\n Aqua Alex: \n (1)removed the need for the js file and created a Workerscript to enable autocalculation of Damage Bonus and Build even for people without a Pro account.\n (2) added calculation of move\n (3) BONUS/PENALTY Dice rolls - Purple-Grey Button is for current Roll template (it rolls normal, 1 bonus, 2 bonus, 1 penalty, 2 penalty dice and shows all results), Green button is for new smaller (only normal roll) template. \n\n The in-game option \"NPCs\" enables a section where player companions or Keeper NPCs can be recorded. \n\n The in-game option to \"Hide Sheet\", when enabled, hides all Major Sheet Sections, apart from Common Dice Rolls, Talents, and NPCs, in order to simulate a clean NPC sheet for Keeper's use.",
